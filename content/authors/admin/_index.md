Hello!

I'm José. I'm currently working on my master's thesis on Language Models for Spanish under the supervision of [Felipe Bravo-Márquez](https://felipebravom.com/). I'm also working part-time as Machine Learning Engineer at [CENIA](https://cenia.cl).

I'm member of the [ReLeLa](https://relela.com/) research group at [DCC UChile](https://dcc.uchile.cl) and my research interests include Artificial Intelligence and how to handle and optimize these systems for production environments.

On my spare time I enjoy from listen to music and learning new things from podcasts or audiobooks.
