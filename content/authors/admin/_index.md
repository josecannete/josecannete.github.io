Hello there, I'm Jos√©! üòÅ

I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Walmart, passionate about leveraging AI for real-world impact. I hold an MSc. in Computer Science, graduated from Universidad de Chile, and specialize in Language Models.

I pioneered [**BETO**](https://github.com/dccuchile/beto), the first BERT-like model for Spanish, and introduced [**ALBETO**](https://github.com/dccuchile/lightweight-spanish-language-models), a suite of light and fast models based in ALBERT for Spanish. 

Formerly a founding member of the [ReLeLa](https://relela.com/) research group at [DCC UChile](https://dcc.uchile.cl), I've passionately explored Artificial Intelligence and optimizing systems for real-world applications. 

Outside of work, music and podcasts are my go-to sources for relaxation and learning.

Feel free to reach out ‚Äì you'll find my contact details in the adjacent bio.
